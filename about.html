    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Michael Lamothe</strong>, and EverAfterPicks is more than just a wedding inspiration site—it's a love letter to my fiancée, Kailey.</p>

    <p>We recently got engaged, and I couldn’t be more excited to start this journey with her. Kailey used to be a wedding photographer, capturing the magic of other couples’ big days. Now she’s a teacher, pouring her heart into the classroom. She’s creative, compassionate, and deserves a wedding that reflects everything she’s given to others.</p>

    <p>I created EverAfterPicks as a way to share the beautiful, rustic, and romantic finds I’ve discovered while planning our own wedding. It’s also a way to support our dream—through affiliate links, we may earn a small commission when you shop through the site. Every bit helps us build the wedding Kailey has always imagined, and we’re so grateful for your support.</p>

    <p>Whether you're planning your own celebration or just love timeless wedding style, I hope this space feels like a cozy corner of the internet where inspiration meets intention.</p>

    <p>Thanks for being here, and for being part of our story.</p>

    <p>With love,<br />
    <strong>Michael Lamothe</strong></p>
